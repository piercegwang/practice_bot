* Heifetz Discord Bot

The main purpose of this discord bot is to create a practice room functionality in which people can join a practice room and practice in an environment where others can then join, listen, and encourage.

* Version Control

** Version 1
The first version of this bot will simply be the voice channel functionality.

A user will be able to join a voice channel and if they are the first person there, then they will be unmuted and be able to practice.

If someone else is already in the channel practicing then they will be server muted.
